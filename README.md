# JavaScript Digital Clock
### Description:
this is a digital clock made with JavaScript utilizing SVG's to resemble the old digital-segment display elements that made up the numbers. 
### Why?
It is true, it would have been easier to create this same effect using a text element with a "digital display font" and simply changing the content accordingly. However, this was more fun and no downloading of a font was needed.

### Changes Made: 
+ Minutes and hours no longer updated every "x" ticks. Now each minute is cleared and updated every "0" second mark. Same for Hours.
